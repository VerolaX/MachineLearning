This homework requires us to implement the perceptron algorithm. All codes are written in Xiao_perceptron.py. 

In this homework I did some experiments on both numbers of iterations and different learning rates. 
The plot shows how the model's accuracies on training set and development set changes as number of iterations changes.
From the graph, I can tell that there is not very big difference between the accuracies on training data and on development data, and overall accuracies do not change much with the increment of iterations.
