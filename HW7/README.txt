Submitted files:
Xiao_em_gaussian.py -- source code for this homework
tied.png -- picture that shows the log likelihood change corresponding to changes in cluster number and iterations with one single covariance matrix for all clusters
not_tied.png -- picture that shows the log likelihood change corresponding to changes in cluster number and iterations with different covariance matrix for each cluster
tied.csv -- a csv file that contains the experiment results, providing --tied argument. It records the log likelihood based on different combinations of cluster numbers and iteration numbers.
not_tied.csv -- a csv file that contains the experiment results with different covariance matrix for different clusters.
